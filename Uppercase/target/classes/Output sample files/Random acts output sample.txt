MANY AMERICANS TODAY ARE BLIND TO WHAT LIFE IS LIKE IN OTHER COUNTRIES. AFTER WATCHING HOLLYWOOD MOVIES WHERE CHINESE ARE ONLY PORTRAYED AS EITHER KUNG FU MASTERS OR SUPER GENIUSES, IT IS NO WONDER SO FEW AMERICANS KNOW ABOUT THE REALITY OF CHINA TODAY. BUT NOVELS LIKE GOLD BOY, EMERALD GIRL, WRITTEN BY YIYUN LI, HELP TO SHOW SOME OF THE MORE SOMBER REALITIES OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA. WHEN READING THIS NOVEL, IT SEEMS AS IF YIYUN LI IS PORTRAYING CHINA AS BEING FILLED WITH LONELINESS AND DESPAIR, BRINGING ABOUT AN OVERALL TONE OF COMPLACENCY FOR THE NOVELLA “KINDNESS.” BUT CONTRARY TO THE TONE OF THIS STORY, LI UNVEILS HOPE HIDDEN WITHIN THE ENCOUNTERS OF OTHERS AND THEIR POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE INFLUENCES.

FOR THE DURATION OF THIS NOVELLA, MOYAN IS LEFT WITH THE FEELING THAT SHE WAS MEANT TO BE LONELY IN LIFE, THIS BEING SHOWN WITH HER THOUGHTS ABOUT HER FAMILY, “[W]E WERE THE LONELIEST FAMILY IN THE WORLD BECAUSE WE WERE MEANT TO BE THAT WAY” (LI 53). EVEN FROM THE BEGINNING MOYAN BELIEVED SHE WAS MEANT TO BE ALONE AND AWAY FROM PEOPLE AS SHOWN FROM THE QUOTE ABOVE, AND THIS BELIEF WAS INFLUENCED BY HER MENTOR, PROFESSOR SHAN.
MOYAN HAD MET PROFESSOR SHAN AS A YOUNG GIRL, SHE WAS TWELVE WHILE PROFESSOR SHAN WAS IN HER MID-SIXTIES.

ALONG WITH SLOWLY TEACHING MOYAN TO READ ENGLISH, SHE ALSO TAUGHT MOYAN TO HAVE A BLEAK OUTLOOK ON LIFE.

OVERALL, THE NOVEL GOLD BOY, EMERALD GIRL IS FILLED WITH SORROW AND REGRET, WITH THE NOVELLA “KINDNESS” SHOWING A COMPLACENT TONE. BUT DESPITE ALL THE SORROW AND LOSS IN THIS NOVELLA, A RAY OF HOPE CAN BE FOUND IN MOYAN’S WORDS.

OVERALL, EVEN THOUGH THIS BOOK IS FILLED WITH SADNESS, IT ALSO SHOWS THAT EVEN AMONGST SADNESS, THERE CAN ALWAYS BE HOPE FOUND IN THE KINDNESS OF OTHERS.
