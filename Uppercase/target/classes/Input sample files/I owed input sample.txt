I owed $2.29, Jo owed $5.27, and Lu owed $10.31 and paid $6.98., She ordered 150# of #1
potatoes (which retail for 50# @ $10.), The parents believe 4 + 4, 2 - 2, and 2 - 4 are
easy to calculate., Catalog #327 lists 4 @ $1.07, 31 @ $3.30, 64 @ $2.10, and 19 @ $2.60.,
I know that 2 - 2 = 0., I need 3# of #2 nails, 2# of #8 bolts, and 79# of #5 clips., On 1/25 
the Hartly Company* stock decreased 14 1/8 points!
